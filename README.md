# Hi-Score-Twitch *DEPRECIATED*
  - An extension for Twitch streamers to allow them to let their viewers play on their stream while they are away.
  - Just a tad bit of competition to get that ultimate high score!
  - Discontinued project as of 2-26-19
  - May recontinue project on a later date (don't count on it though)
